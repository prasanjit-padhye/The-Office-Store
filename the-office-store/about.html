			It all started in 1988. A ton of teen retail accessory stores littered the malls, but there weren't any
			cool, music-inspired accessory destinations for both guys and girls. Enter The Office Store.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 50px;text-align: justify;font-size: 30px;">
			As 1990 rolled around, adding apparel to our music mix seemed like a no-brainer, so we brought in the
			ultimate music fan essential: band T-shirts. Customers flipped when they walked into Hot Topic stores and
			saw Bauhaus, The Cure, TSOL, and Depeche Mode rock tees. Within a year, we offered about 50 different band
			titles, along with rock-inspired clothing lines like Lip Service and Serious. As we continued to expand, we
			discovered that our customers were also drawn to the underground cartoon, cult movie, and comic book scenes,
			so we brought the world of South Park, Care Bears, Superman, SpongeBob and tons of other pop icons right to
			them!</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 50px;text-align: justify;font-size: 30px;">
			Today, Hot Topic offers band-related apparel and accessories, licensed merchandise, and fashion apparel and
			accessories, which you can find at more than 600 stores (check out our store locator to find the location
			nearest you!) and online at www.hottopic.com. More than 25 years later you can still feel the passion for
			music and pop culture in our stores, at HQ, and in our distribution centers.

		<p style="padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 50px;text-align: justify;font-size: 20px;">The Office is an American
			mockumentary sitcom television series that depicts the everyday work lives of
			office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. It
			aired on NBC from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, spanning a total of nine seasons. Based on the
			2001â€“2003 BBC series of the same name created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, it was adapted for
			American television by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The
			Simpsons. It was co-produced by Daniels's Deedle-Dee Productions, and Reveille Productions (later Shine
			America), in association with Universal Television. The original executive producers were Daniels, Gervais,
			Merchant, Howard Klein, and Ben Silverman, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.</p>

		<p style="padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 50px;text-align: justify;font-size: 20px;">Like its British
			counterpart, the series was filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio audience or a
			laugh track to simulate the look of an actual documentary. The series debuted on NBC as a mid-season
			replacement and aired 201 episodes for its run. The Office originally featured Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson,
			John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and B. J. Novak as the main cast; however, the series experienced numerous
			changes to its ensemble cast during its run. Notable stars outside the original main cast include Ed Helms,
			Amy Ryan, Mindy Kaling, Craig Robinson, James Spader, Ellie Kemper, and Catherine Tate.</p>

		<p style="padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 50px;text-align: justify;font-size: 20px;">The Office was met with
			mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, particularly
			those featuring Carell, received significant acclaim from television critics as the show's characters,
			content, structure, and tone diverged considerably from the British version. These seasons were included on
			several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a Peabody Award in 2006, two
			Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards,
			including one for Outstanding Comedy Series, in 2006. The eighth season was criticized for a decline in
			quality. Many saw Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the ninth and final
			season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The series finale, which originally aired
			on May 16, 2013, was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers and garnered critical acclaim.[2] In 2016,
			Rolling Stone named The Office one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time.</p>
